This is a simple flask app that lets you browse Pinot 2.0 clusters. It gathers
info by hitting pinot-controller endpoints and querying ZK.

Set up steps:

1) Run ./bootstrap.sh to install initial python dependencies and create virtual
   env.

2) Copy config.sample.yml to config.yml and hand edit as needed

3) Do ./start.sh or ./stop.sh to start in background

Do ". activate" and python run.py to start in foreground

4) Logs will be written to logs/webui.log
